#Neural AMP Project
This is now a separated version of Neural AMP, which is better integrated 
and is more convenient to run on a server. Neural AMP is designed to solve 
the sparse recovery problem, especially the user detection problem in massive 
MIMO scenario. The project is also convenient to train any other relevant models. 

If you want to run the codes, you will need to at least install these packages:
* numpy
* pytorch 

And these packages are recommended:
* tensorboardX

The structure of this project is flexible. You can easily manage the files 
by changing the relative path in the codes.
